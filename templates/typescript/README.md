# api-js

Welcome to `api-js` – a powerful and flexible framework designed to streamline the creation of REST APIs with Node.js and Express. Whether you’re a beginner looking for a quick setup or an experienced developer seeking a customizable solution, `api-js` simplifies the process of building and configuring your APIs.

## Overview

`api-js` automates the setup of common backend components, so you can focus on developing your application instead of spending time on boilerplate code and configuration. With `api-js`, you can choose your preferred language (TypeScript or JavaScript) and database (Mongoose or Prisma) during installation. The framework also provides a well-structured folder layout and integrates useful tools like `dotenv` for environment management and logging capabilities.

## Features

- **Choose Your Language:** Options for TypeScript or JavaScript.
- **Flexible Database Integration:** Supports Mongoose for MongoDB or Prisma for various databases.
- **Automatic Configuration:** Sets up Express, MongoDB, and other dependencies.
- **Structured Project Layout:** Creates folders for routes, controllers, models, utilities, and configuration.
- **Open Source:** Contribute and collaborate with the community.

## Project Structure

When you set up your project with `api-js`, the following folder structure will be created:

```
my-api-project/
├── config/          # Configuration files (e.g., environment settings)
├── controllers/     # Route controllers
├── models/          # Database models
├── routes/          # API routes
├── utils/           # Utility functions and helpers
├── .env             # Environment variables
├── package.json     # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json    # TypeScript configuration (if TypeScript is chosen)
├── index.js         # Entry point for the application
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```
